            <h2>Nietzsche's Reign</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, born on 15 October 1844 was a German philosopher, cultural critic and philologist whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history.

                    He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.

                <li>
                    In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, The Birth of Tragedy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because his health deteriorated steadily, he resigned his professorial chair on June 14, 1879, and was granted a pension of 3,000 Swiss francs per year for six years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche’s acknowledged literary and philosophical masterpiece in biblical-narrative form, Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra), was published between 1883 and 1885 in four parts, the last of which was a private printing at his own expense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche’s final lucid year, 1888, was a period of supreme productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche collapsed in the streets of Turin, Italy, in January 1889, having lost control of his mental faculties completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche spent the last 11 years of his life in total mental darkness, first in a Basel asylum, then in Naumburg under his mother’s care and, after her death in 1897, in Weimar in his sister’s care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.
