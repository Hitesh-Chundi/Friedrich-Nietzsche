            <h2>Life of Nietzsche</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, born on 15 October 1844 was a German philosopher, cultural critic and philologist whose work has exerted a profound influence on modern intellectual history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He became the youngest person ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, The Birth of Tragedy
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because his health deteriorated steadily, he resigned his professorial chair on June 14, 1879, and was granted a pension of 3,000 Swiss francs per year for six years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche’s acknowledged literary and philosophical masterpiece in biblical-narrative form, Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra), was published between 1883 and 1885 in four parts, the last of which was a private printing at his own expense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche’s final lucid year, 1888, was a period of supreme productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche collapsed in the streets of Turin, Italy, in January 1889, having lost control of his mental faculties completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nietzsche spent the last 11 years of his life in total mental darkness, first in a Basel asylum, then in Naumburg under his mother’s care and, after her death in 1897, in Weimar in his sister’s care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways.
